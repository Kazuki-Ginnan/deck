## Assignment (Implementing a routing algorithm and a visualization function)

* Replace a routing algorithm of the routing switch from the Dijkstra's algorithm to other one.
  * Modifications on the Dijkstra's algorithm, such as introducing link weights, are also acceptable.
* Visualize the behavior of the controller of the routing switch on a web browser
  * Selected paths and the behavior of your routing algorithm must be clearly drawn on the visualized images
